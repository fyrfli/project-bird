# "Twitter Clone" project

This is the project from the Udemy course [Front End Web Development Bootcamp - Build a Twitter Clone](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-web-development-bootcamp-build-a-twitter-clone/learn/lecture/15108620#overview). The lecturer called his clone "Twirrer" but I find that a little corny and so I took some poetic license and called mine "Bird!" - exclamation included. And yes, I am fully aware that that is just as corny; but it is #me corny rather than #standard corny.

I building straight to the master branch because I don't intend to do anything with it until I am done with the course. Once that's done, I'll release it as is and any further tweaking will be done in branches. (I think that's how most people do it anyway - right?)

## Mirroring

I will mirror this repository to [Github](https://github.com/fyrfli/project-bird) as well so that my stats get updated there as well.

## Future plans for this clone

- I may amuse myself later on and build some real functionality into it but for now, it will remain a clone. 
- I certainly feel like I want to change the color scheme because blue is so very obvious.

## Observations

1. Working with two screens is SO much easier than working on a laptop screen, so much so that even though I really hate Windows, I may just try and move all my development to the desktop ... for now.
